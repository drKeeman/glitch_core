# Lab Journal Entry 1: Initial Setup & Infrastructure
**Date**: 29 July 2025 14:55
**Phase**: Phase 1 - Foundation & Infrastructure
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Ready for Phase 2

## The Setup Challenge

After the initial idea'd been written down, the next step was assembling the project infra.
Lucky me, i have puzzles to gather toghether from prev projects, but this one is a bit more tricky - as I need stable core AND research infra at the same time. So:

## The Technical Stack
It would be locla-fisrt project, but who knows - better to make it ready for sharing/cloud - so docker, obviously
Fastapi (love it), pydantic, redis - pretty classical staff. QDrant as DB (twas interesting iotself to manage postgres with no relational DB)
UV (they finally support workspaces, not perfectly, but can live with that)

**Core Stack here:**
- **FastAPI**: becouse its fast, async and i just love it
- **uv**: its fast, its reliable, its cool
- **Redis**:
- **Qdrant**: Vector DB (embeddings and metadata, so no pg needed)
- **Docker Compose**: it works on my machine, and yours machine, and any machine, lol
- **pytest**: not TDD, but lets make it reliable



## Results

✅ **make start** starts all services (Docker)
✅ **make test** runs comprehensive test suite  
✅ API health endpoint returns 200
✅ Redis and Qdrant connections work
✅ Docker containers build and run successfully
