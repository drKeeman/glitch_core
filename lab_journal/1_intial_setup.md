# Lab Journal Entry 1: Initial Setup & Infrastructure
**Date**: 29 July 2025 14:55
**Phase**: Phase 1 - Foundation & Infrastructure
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Ready for Phase 2

## The Setup Challenge

After the initial idea crystallized, the next step was assembling the project infra.
Lucky me, i have puzzled to gather toghether from prev projects, but this was a bit more tricky - as we need stable core AND research infra at the same time. So,

## The Technical Architecture Decision

Fastapi (love it), Docker-first, pudantic - pretty classical staff
UV (they finally support workspaces, not perfectly, but can live with that)

**Core Stack here:**
- **FastAPI**: becouse its fast, async and i just love it
- **uv**: its fast, its reliable, its cool
- **Redis**:
- **Qdrant**: Vector DB (embeddings adn metadata, so no pg needed)
- **Docker Compose**: it works on my machine, and yours machine, and any machine :D
- **pytest**: not TDD, but lets make it reliable


## The Implementation

### 1. Project Structure Setup
Started with the directory structure from the PRD. The key insight was organizing around clear separation of concerns:
```
src/
├── api/           # FastAPI routes and middleware
├── core/          # Configuration, logging, exceptions
├── storage/       # Redis and Qdrant clients
├── models/        # Data models (next phase)
├── services/      # Business logic (next phase)
└── assessment/    # Psychiatric tools (next phase)
```

### 2. Configuration Management
Implemented Pydantic settings with environment variable support. `ConfigDict` instead of the deprecated `Config`.

**Key Features:**
- Environment variable override
- Type validation
- Default values for all settings
- Structured logging configuration

### 3. Docker Infrastructure
Created a multi-service Docker setup with health checks:

**Services:**
- **app**: FastAPI application with uv package manager
- **redis**: Session storage with persistence
- **qdrant**: Vector database for memory embeddings
+ containers names (ever tried to undersatnd what redis-33 stand for?)

**Docker Optimizations:**
- Multi-stage build with uv for faster dependency resolution
- Health checks for all services
- Volume mounts for data persistence
- Network isolation

### 4. Testing Framework
Set up comprehensive testing with pytest:
- Async test support for database operations
- Fixtures for Redis and Qdrant clients
- Coverage reporting
- API endpoint testing

## Results

### 1. Docker Build Success

### 2. API Health Check Working

### 3. Test Suite Passing
All 7 initial tests green, so
- Configuration mgmt works
- API endpoints, work
- Health checks, work

## The Technical Decisions

### Why uv over pip/poetry?
- **Speed**: 10-100x faster dependency resolution
- **Reliability**: Deterministic lock files
- **Modern**: Built for Python 3.12+
- **Simplicity**: Single tool for all package management (and cool deps grouping)

### Why FastAPI over Flask/Django?
- **Performance**: Async by default
- **Type Safety**: Built-in Pydantic integration
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated OpenAPI docs


### Why Docker Compose?
- **Development**: Easy local development
- **Production**: Same environment everywhere
- **Services**: Redis and Qdrant as separate services
- **Health Checks**: Built-in monitoring

## The Quality Gates Met

✅ **make start** starts all services (Docker)
✅ **make test** runs comprehensive test suite  
✅ API health endpoint returns 200
✅ Redis and Qdrant connections work
✅ Docker containers build and run successfully
