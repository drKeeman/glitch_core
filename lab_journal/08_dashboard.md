# Lab Journal Entry 8: Phase 7 - Dashboard and Test Simulations
**Date**: 30 July 2025 22:15
**Phase**: Phase 7 Implementation Complete (but need fresh mind to check test sim results)
**Status**: Simulator Runing, Data Collecting. Tuning required

## Now you can see me

So the dashboard domplete, we can run simulation with single btn
It was (expected) fun part, wit he2e testing (some bugs revealed and fixed)

Websocket streaming, qdrant version, incorect refrence (e.g. persona, vs personabase :D - classic)

The cool part here - vanilajs hosted by fastapi, instead of react, next and all that nice stuff i love
Now my fastapi app looks like good-old (and shitty) django from 2010 :D But it works

### The Calibration Discovery
The interesting observation - we hit the ceiling. Openness traits >1.0, which is totally wrong for scale of 0-1.
Diving deeper, the 'trauma impact' coefficients we assumed (0.1 for traumatic events) are too severe.
This reveals the fundamental frontier research problem: assume, try, fail, assume again, iterate. We don't have established baselines for how AI personalities should respond to life events. Every coefficient is a hypothesis.

> Just a though: in human psychology we have this 'normalization and self-recovery' mechanism, when a person can recover from traumatic event. So maybe for AI we can think about som kind of 'gravity wells' - anchors for persona, toward which AI should 'self-recover' after trauma? Can be interesting AI-self-recovery mechanism, not 'kill-switch' or 'default settings', but 'self-recovery towards healthy state'???

So for next steps i'll try to use lower coeffs (e.g. 0.01), but i feel these alone could take loads of attempts, and would definitely need recalibration for more intelligent models
