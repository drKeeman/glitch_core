# Lab Journal Entry 9: Phase 8 - Statistics, Visualizations & Notebooks
**Date**: 31 July 2025 01:25
**Status**: Stat, Visualization tools and notebooks skeletons are ready

## 

Its would be a bit of stat theater, but when we add full model to power the project it would make sence and we could just use analytical tools we already have, so even we can trust this 'local sim' data, we can build, test and trust our tools

Another cool staff here - modular tooling (as we plan to use loads of charts and visualization - why not to decouple them from notebooks, and just simply import, instead of recreating plotly boilerplate each and every time?)

The same with stat analysys - its pretty standard, so simport with args - its a bit of cheating, but looks beautiful. Tnx for code reviews and practices that i learned from fastapi community
Btw, plan python is much easy to debug and fix, then ipynb, so we can trust tools and focus on analysys

So what we have for descriptive analytics:
- Persona validation suite: uploader, traints, psy scales, coreecaltion, even demographics for future;
- Longitudial analysis: assessment tajectories, oersonality trait drift atterns, machenistic trends, change point (alarm!) detection - main research part, actually is here
