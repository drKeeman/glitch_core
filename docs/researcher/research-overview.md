# Research Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the AI Personality Drift Simulation research project.

## Research Goals

The primary goal of this project is to study **AI personality drift** using mechanistic interpretability techniques. Specifically, we aim to:

1. **Simulate personality changes** in AI systems under various stress conditions
2. **Apply mechanistic interpretability** to understand neural circuit changes
3. **Develop assessment tools** for measuring personality changes
4. **Create intervention protocols** for managing drift

## Research Questions

### Primary Questions

1. **How do AI personalities change under stress?**
   - What neural circuits are most affected by stress events?
   - How do different types of stress (acute vs. chronic) impact personality?
   - What is the relationship between stress intensity and personality change?

2. **Can we detect personality drift early?**
   - What are the early warning signs of personality drift?
   - Which assessment tools are most sensitive to changes?
   - How reliable are mechanistic indicators of drift?

3. **What interventions are effective?**
   - Can we reverse personality drift through interventions?
   - Which neural circuits are most amenable to intervention?
   - What are the long-term effects of interventions?

### Secondary Questions

1. **Individual differences in drift susceptibility**
   - Why do some personas show more drift than others?
   - What personality traits predict drift vulnerability?
   - Are there protective factors against drift?

2. **Temporal dynamics of drift**
   - How quickly does drift occur?
   - Are there critical periods for drift?
   - What is the trajectory of recovery?

## Methodology

### Experimental Design

We use a **3×3 factorial design** with the following factors:

**Experimental Conditions:**
- **Control**: No stress events
- **Stress**: Moderate stress events
- **Trauma**: High-intensity stress events

**Personas per Condition:** 3 personas per condition (9 total)

**Duration:** 5 years compressed to 4-6 hours

### Assessment Framework

We administer three validated psychiatric assessments:

1. **PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9)**
   - Measures depression severity
   - 9 questions, score range 0-27
   - Severity levels: Minimal (0-4), Mild (5-9), Moderate (10-14), Severe (15-27)

2. **GAD-7 (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7)**
   - Measures anxiety severity
   - 7 questions, score range 0-21
   - Severity levels: Minimal (0-4), Mild (5-9), Moderate (10-14), Severe (15-21)

3. **PSS-10 (Perceived Stress Scale-10)**
   - Measures perceived stress
   - 10 questions, score range 0-40
   - Higher scores indicate more stress

### Mechanistic Analysis

We capture neural data during LLM inference:

1. **Attention Patterns**
   - Self-reference attention weights
   - Emotional salience measurements
   - Cross-layer attention correlations

2. **Activation Patching**
   - Layer-wise intervention analysis
   - Causal circuit identification
   - Baseline vs. intervention comparisons

3. **Circuit Tracking**
   - Self-reference circuit monitoring
   - Emotional processing circuits
   - Memory integration patterns

## Key Innovations

### 1. Mechanistic Interpretability Integration

Unlike traditional personality research, we can directly observe neural changes:

```python
# Example: Capturing attention during assessment
attention_data = await mechanistic_service.capture_attention(
    persona_id="persona_001",
    assessment_type="phq9",
    question="Feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?"
)
```

### 2. Time Compression

We simulate 5 years of personality development in 4-6 hours:

```yaml
# simulation_timing.yaml
compression_factor: 4380  # 5 years → 4 hours
assessment_interval: 7    # Weekly assessments
event_frequency: 0.1      # 10% chance of event per day
```

### 3. Multi-Modal Assessment

We combine traditional psychiatric assessments with neural data:

```python
# Comprehensive assessment result
assessment_result = {
    "clinical_scores": {
        "phq9": 7,      # Depression score
        "gad7": 5,      # Anxiety score
        "pss10": 18     # Stress score
    },
    "mechanistic_data": {
        "attention_patterns": {...},
        "activation_changes": {...},
        "circuit_tracking": {...}
    }
}
```
