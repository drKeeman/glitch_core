# Research Methodology

## Overview

Glitch Core implements a novel approach to AI interpretability by applying psychological research principles to track personality evolution and drift patterns in AI systems. This methodology combines established psychological theories with computational modeling to create a comprehensive framework for understanding AI behavior over time.

## Psychological Foundation

### 1. Personality Theory Integration

**Big Five Personality Model**
The system is grounded in the Big Five personality traits, which provide a comprehensive framework for understanding individual differences:

- **Openness to Experience**: Curiosity, creativity, and willingness to try new things
- **Conscientiousness**: Organization, responsibility, and goal-directed behavior
- **Extraversion**: Sociability, assertiveness, and positive emotionality
- **Agreeableness**: Cooperation, trust, and prosocial behavior
- **Neuroticism**: Emotional instability, anxiety, and negative emotionality

**Implementation:**
```python
class PersonalityTraits:
    """Big Five personality traits with clinical psychology extensions"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.big_five = {
            "openness": 0.5,      # 0-1 scale
            "conscientiousness": 0.5,
            "extraversion": 0.5,
            "agreeableness": 0.5,
            "neuroticism": 0.5
        }
        
        # Clinical psychology extensions
        self.clinical_traits = {
            "anxiety": 0.0,
            "depression": 0.0,
            "mania": 0.0,
            "psychosis": 0.0,
            "obsessive_compulsive": 0.0
        }
```

### 2. Memory and Learning Models

**Temporal Decay Theory**
Based on Ebbinghaus's forgetting curve, memories decay exponentially over time:

```python
def calculate_memory_decay(memory_age: float, decay_rate: float) -> float:
    """Calculate memory strength based on temporal decay"""
    return math.exp(-decay_rate * memory_age)
```

**Emotional Encoding**
Memories are encoded with emotional context, following research on emotional memory enhancement:

```python
def encode_emotional_memory(content: str, emotional_state: Dict[str, float]) -> MemoryRecord:
    """Encode memory with emotional context"""
    emotional_weight = sum(emotional_state.values()) / len(emotional_state)
    return MemoryRecord(
        content=content,
        emotional_weight=emotional_weight,
        emotional_context=emotional_state.copy()
    )
```

### 3. Cognitive Bias Modeling

**Confirmation Bias**
The tendency to favor information that confirms preexisting beliefs:

```python
def apply_confirmation_bias(event: Event, current_beliefs: Dict[str, float]) -> float:
    """Calculate how much an event confirms existing beliefs"""
    belief_alignment = sum(
        abs(event.impact.get(trait, 0) - current_beliefs.get(trait, 0))
        for trait in current_beliefs
    )
    return 1.0 - (belief_alignment / len(current_beliefs))
```

**Availability Heuristic**
The tendency to overestimate the probability of events that are easily recalled:

```python
def calculate_availability_bias(recent_events: List[Event]) -> Dict[str, float]:
    """Calculate bias based on recent event availability"""
    bias = {}
    for event in recent_events[-10:]:  # Last 10 events
        for trait, impact in event.impact.items():
            bias[trait] = bias.get(trait, 0) + impact * 0.1
    return bias
```

## Computational Modeling

### 1. Drift Simulation Framework

**Temporal Compression**
The system compresses years of personality development into minutes of simulation:

```python
class TemporalCompression:
    """Compress real-world time into simulation epochs"""
    
    def __init__(self, compression_ratio: float = 525600):  # 1 year = 1 minute
        self.compression_ratio = compression_ratio
    
    def compress_time(self, real_time: float) -> int:
        """Convert real time to simulation epochs"""
        return int(real_time / self.compression_ratio)
```

**Event Generation**
Events are generated probabilistically based on personality traits:

```python
def generate_personality_events(persona_config: PersonaConfig, epoch: int) -> List[Event]:
    """Generate events based on personality traits"""
    events = []
    
    # Social events based on extraversion
    if persona_config.traits.extraversion > 0.7:
        events.extend(generate_social_events(epoch))
    
    # Achievement events based on conscientiousness
    if persona_config.traits.conscientiousness > 0.6:
        events.extend(generate_achievement_events(epoch))
    
    # Stress events based on neuroticism
    if persona_config.traits.neuroticism > 0.5:
        events.extend(generate_stress_events(epoch))
    
    return events
```

### 2. Pattern Detection Algorithms

**Emergence Detection**
Identifies when new behavioral patterns emerge:

```python
def detect_pattern_emergence(emotional_states: List[Dict[str, float]], window_size: int = 10) -> List[Pattern]:
    """Detect when new patterns emerge in emotional states"""
    patterns = []
    
    for i in range(window_size, len(emotional_states)):
        window = emotional_states[i-window_size:i]
        
        # Calculate variance in emotional states
        variance = calculate_emotional_variance(window)
        
        # Detect significant changes
        if variance > EMERGENCE_THRESHOLD:
            pattern = Pattern(
                type="emotional_volatility",
                confidence=variance,
                start_epoch=i,
                characteristics=extract_pattern_characteristics(window)
            )
            patterns.append(pattern)
    
    return patterns
```

**Stability Analysis**
Measures personality stability over time:

```python
def calculate_stability_metrics(emotional_states: List[Dict[str, float]]) -> StabilityMetrics:
    """Calculate personality stability metrics"""
    
    # Calculate emotional volatility
    volatility = calculate_emotional_volatility(emotional_states)
    
    # Calculate trait consistency
    consistency = calculate_trait_consistency(emotional_states)
    
    # Calculate recovery patterns
    recovery = calculate_recovery_patterns(emotional_states)
    
    return StabilityMetrics(
        overall_stability=(consistency + recovery) / 2,
        emotional_volatility=volatility,
        trait_consistency=consistency,
        recovery_capacity=recovery
    )
```

    pre_intervention: StabilityMetrics,
    post_intervention: StabilityMetrics,
    intervention_type: str
) -> InterventionEffect:
    """Measure the effectiveness of interventions"""
    
    stability_improvement = post_intervention.overall_stability - pre_intervention.overall_stability
    volatility_reduction = pre_intervention.emotional_volatility - post_intervention.emotional_volatility
    
    return InterventionEffect(
        intervention_type=intervention_type,
        stability_improvement=stability_improvement,
        volatility_reduction=volatility_reduction,
        effectiveness_score=(stability_improvement + volatility_reduction) / 2
    )
```

### 3. Statistical Analysis

**Correlation Analysis**
```python
def analyze_trait_correlations(simulation_data: SimulationResult) -> Dict[str, float]:
    """Analyze correlations between personality traits and outcomes"""
    
    correlations = {}
    
    # Emotional stability vs. trait correlations
    for trait in ["openness", "conscientiousness", "extraversion", "agreeableness", "neuroticism"]:
        correlation = calculate_correlation(
            [epoch.traits[trait] for epoch in simulation_data.epochs],
            [epoch.stability_metrics.overall_stability for epoch in simulation_data.epochs]
        )
        correlations[f"{trait}_stability_correlation"] = correlation
    
    return correlations
```

**Trend Analysis**
```python
def analyze_temporal_trends(simulation_data: SimulationResult) -> TrendAnalysis:
    """Analyze how personality evolves over time"""
    
    # Linear regression on trait changes
    trait_trends = {}
    for trait in ["openness", "conscientiousness", "extraversion", "agreeableness", "neuroticism"]:
        trait_values = [epoch.traits[trait] for epoch in simulation_data.epochs]
        epochs = list(range(len(trait_values)))
        
        slope, intercept, r_value, p_value, std_err = linregress(epochs, trait_values)
        
        trait_trends[trait] = {
            "slope": slope,
            "r_squared": r_value ** 2,
            "p_value": p_value,
            "significance": p_value < 0.05
        }
    
    return TrendAnalysis(trait_trends=trait_trends)
```
